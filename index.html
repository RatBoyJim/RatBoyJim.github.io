    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I am a budding developer with a wealth of experience in providing excellent customer service within a team-based environment in varying roles. I have had a lifelong love of technology going all the way back to being 10 years old and doing some simple programming in Basic.</p>
    <p>This early interest in coding was rekindled when working with HTML during my last employment. Having then been made redundant I decided to put my efforts into forging a career that I will both enjoy and prosper in.</p>
    <p>Now, as a newly trained software developer, I'm excited to combine my past experience with my new skillset to become an effective, enthusiastic and efficient member of Scotland's growing tech sector.</p>
